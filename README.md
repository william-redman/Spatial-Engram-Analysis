# Spatial-Engram-Analysis

This repository includes scripts to read and process data from Milczarek et al.'s 2018 Current Biology paper ("Spatial Memory Engram
in the Mouse Retrosplenial Cortex"), scripts to do statistical analysis of how different the data that was reported by Milczarek et al. is 
from a purely spatially driven model of activity), and additional analysis, all of which is explained in a write-up that will be put in
the repository shortly. Note that the activity data was taken from Milczarek et al. from their open access data repository, and the animal choice data was sent to us by Prof. Sengpiel. 

Any questions or comments about the code and/or the write-up can be sent to wredman@ucsb.edu
